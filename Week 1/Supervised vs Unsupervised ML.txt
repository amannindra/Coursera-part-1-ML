Machine Learning: “Field of Study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” - Arthur Samuel (1959)

Machine Learning algorithms
 - Supervised Learning
    - used most in real world applications
    - course 1 and 2 
 - Unsupervised Learning
    - course 3
    - Recommender systems
    - Reinforcement learnings

Supervised Learning Part 1
    - learns from being given "right answers"
    - email -> spam?   -----> Spam filtering
    - audio -> text transcript ----> speech recognition
    - english -> spanish -----> machine translation
    - ad, user info -> click ----> online advertising
    - image, rador info -> position of other cars ---> self-driving car
    - image of phone -> defect? ---> visual inspection
        
    Regression learning
        - Predict a number infinity many possible outputs

    Classification learning
        - Predict a number with limited amount of outputs or predict categories
